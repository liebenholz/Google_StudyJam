Unless you have a specific requirement for VPC, we recommend using a Public Endpoint. Despite the term \"public\" in its name, it does not imply open access to the public internet. Rather, it functions like other endpoints in Vertex AI services, which are secured by default through IAM. Without explicit IAM permissions, as we have previously established, no one can access the endpoint."

    "## Grounding LLM outputs with Vertex AI Vector Search\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have seen, by combining the Embeddings API and Vector Search, you can use the embeddings to \"ground\" LLM outputs to real business data with low latency.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if an user asks a question, Embeddings API can convert it to an embedding, and issue a query on Vector Search to find similar embeddings in its index. Those embeddings represent the actual business data in the databases. As we are just retrieving the business data and not generating any artificial texts, there is no risk of having hallucinations in the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/original_images/10._grounding.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The difference between the questions and answers\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have used the Stack Overflow dataset. There is a reason why we had to use it; As the dataset has many pairs of **questions and answers**, so you can just find questions similar to your question to find answers to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many business use cases, the semantics (meaning) of questions and answers are different. Also, there could be cases where you would want to add variety of recommended or personalized items to the results, like product search on e-commerce sites.\n",
    "\n",
    "In these cases, the simple semantics search don't work well. It's more like a recommendation system problem where you may want to train a model (e.g. Two-Tower model) to learn the relationship between the question embedding space and answer embedding space. Also, many production systems adds reranking phase after the semantic search to achieve higher search quality. Please see [Scaling deep retrieval with TensorFlow Recommenders and Vertex AI Matching Engine](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/scaling-deep-retrieval-tensorflow-two-towers-architecture) to learn more.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Hybrid of semantic + keyword search\n",
    "\n",
    "Another typical challenge you will face in production system is to support keyword search combined with the semantic search. For example, for e-commerce product search, you may want to let users find product by entering its product name or model number. As LLM doesn't memorize those product names or model numbers, semantic search can't handle those \"usual\" search functionalities.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Vertex AI Search](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/vertex-ai-search-and-conversation-is-now-generally-available) is another product you may consider for those requirements. While Vector Search provides a simple semantic search capability only, Search provides a integrated search solution that combines semantic search, keyword search, reranking and filtering, available as an out-of-the-box tool.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What about Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)?\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we have looked at the simple combination of LLM embeddings and vector search. From this starting point, you may also extend the design to [Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)](https://www.google.com/search?q=Retrieval+Augmented+Generation+(RAG)&oq=Retrieval+Augmented+Generation+(RAG)).\n",
    "\n",
    "RAG is a popular architecture pattern of implementing grounding with LLM with text chat UI. The idea is to have the LLM text chat UI as a frontend for the document retrieval with vector search and summarization of the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-cloudblog-publish/images/Figure-7-Ask_Your_Documents_Flow.max-529x434.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some pros and cons between the two solutions.\n",
    "\n",
    "| | Embeddings + vector search | RAG |\n",
    "|---|---|---|\n",
    "| Design | simple | complex |\n",
    "| UI | Text search UI | Text chat UI |\n",
    "| Summarization of result | No | Yes |\n",
    "| Multi-turn (Context aware) | No | Yes |\n",
    "| Latency | milliseconds | seconds |\n",
    "| Cost | lower | higher |\n",
    "| Hallucinations | No risk | Some risk |\n",
    "\n",
    "The Embedding + vector search pattern we have looked at with this tutorial provides simple, fast and low cost semantic search functionality with the LLM intelligence. RAG adds context-aware text chat experience and result summarization to it. While RAG provides the more \"Gen AI-ish\" experience, it also adds a risk of hallucination and higher cost and time for the text generation.\n",
    "\n",
